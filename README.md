# Voice Assistant with OpenAI and Eleven Labs Text-to-Speech

This Python project implements a voice assistant that uses the OpenAI API for natural language understanding and the Eleven Labs Text-to-Speech API for generating speech responses. You can use this assistant to interact with a wide range of questions and receive voice responses. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the voice assistant on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/thesanju/GPT_voice_assistant.git
   ```


3. navigate to directory
   
    ```bash
    cd GPT_voice_assistant


2. create an vertual environment
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate

5. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

6. rename .env.example to .env
   
   ```bash
   mv .env.example .env

7. Add you're openai and elevenlabs API key's.

8. Start the voice assistant
   ```bash
    python main.py
### you can now chat with you're voice assistant :)

## Project Goals
- Change input from typing to just by asking.
- Make an complete AI assistant with raspberry pi
